She arrives at 7:40, ten minutes late, but the children, Jimmy and Bitsy, are still eating supper,
and their parents are not ready to go yet. From other rooms come the sounds of a baby
screaming, water running, a television musical (no words: probably a dance number &mdash; patterns of
gliding figures come to mind). Mrs. Tucker sweeps into the kitchen, fussing with her hair, and
snatches a baby bottle full of milk out of a pan of warm water, rushes out again. &#8220;Harry!&#8221; she calls.
&#8220;The babysitter&rsquo;s here already!&#8221;

That&rsquo;s My Desire? I&rsquo;ll Be Around? He smiles toothily, beckons faintly with his head, rubs his fast
balding pate. Bewitched, maybe? Or, What&rsquo;s the Reason? He pulls on his shorts, gives his hips a
slap. The baby goes silent in mid-scream. Isn&rsquo;t this the one who used their tub last time? Who&rsquo;s
Sorry Now, that&rsquo;s it.

Jack is wandering around town, not knowing what to do. His girlfriend is babysitting at the
Tuckers&rsquo;, and later, when she&rsquo;s got the kids in bed, maybe he&rsquo;ll drop over there. Sometimes he
watches TV with her when she&rsquo;s babysitting, it&rsquo;s about the only chance he gets to make out a little
since he doesn&rsquo;t own wheels, but they have to be careful because most people don&rsquo;t like their
sitters to have boyfriends over. Just kissing her makes her nervous. She won&rsquo;t close her eyes
because she has to be watching the door all the time. Married people really have it good, he
thinks.

&#8220;Hi,&#8221; the babysitter says to the children, and puts her books on top of the refrigerator. &#8220;What&rsquo;s
for supper?&#8221; The little girl, Bitsy, only stares at her obliquely. She joins them at the end of the
kitchen table. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have to go to bed until nine,&#8221; the boy announces flatly and stuffs his mouth
full of potato chips. The babysitter catches a glimpse of Mr. Tucker hurrying out of the bathroom
in his underwear.

Her tummy. Under her arms. And her feet. Those are the best places. She&rsquo;ll spank him, she says
sometimes. Let her.

That sweet odour that girls have. The softness of her blouse. He catches a glimpse of the gentle
shadows amid her thighs, as she curls her legs up under her. He stares hard at her. He has a lot of
meaning packed into that stare, but she&rsquo;s not even looking. She&rsquo;s popping her gum and watching
television. She&rsquo;s sitting right there, inches away, soft, fragrant, and ready: but what&rsquo;s his next
move? He notices his buddy Mark in the drugstore, playing the pinball machine, and joins him.
&#8220;Hey, this mama&rsquo;s cold, Jack baby! She needs your touch!&#8221;

Mrs. Tucker appears at the kitchen doorway, holding a rolled-up diaper. &#8220;Now, don&rsquo;t just eat
potato chips, Jimmy! See that he eats his hamburger, dear.&#8221; She hurries away to the bathroom.
The boy glares sullenly at the babysitter, silently daring her to carry out the order. &#8220;How about a
little of that good hamburger now, Jimmy?&#8221; she says perfunctorily. He lets half of it drop to the
floor. The baby is silent and a man is singing a love song on the TV. The children crunch chips.

He loves her. She loves him. They whirl airily, stirring a light breeze, through a magical
landscape of rose and emerald and deep blue. Her light brown hair coils and wisps softly in the
breeze, and the soft folds of her white gown tug at her body and then float away. He smiles in a
pulsing crescendo of sincerity and song.

&#8220;You mean she&rsquo;s alone?&#8221; Mark asks. &#8220;Well, there&rsquo;s two or three kids,&#8221; Jack says. He slides the coin
in. There&rsquo;s a rumble of steel balls tumbling, lining up. He pushes a plunger with his thumb, and
one ball pops up in place, hard and glittering with promise. His stare? to say he loves her. That
he cares for her and would protect her, would shield her, if need be, with his own body. Grinning
he bends over the ball to take careful aim: he and Mark have studied this machine and have it
figured out, but still it&rsquo;s not that easy to beat.

On the drive to the party, his mind is partly on the girl, partly on his own high-school days, long
past. Sitting at the end of the kitchen table there with his children, she had seemed to be self-
consciously arching her back, jutting her pert breasts, twitching her thighs: and for whom if not
for him? So she&rsquo;d seen him coming out of there, after all. He smiles. Yet what could he ever do
about it? Those good times are gone, old man. He glances over at his wife, who, readjusting a
garter, asks: &#8220;What do you think of our babysitter?&#8221;

He loves her. She loves him. And then the babies come. And dirty nappies and one goddamn
meal after another. Dishes. Noise. Clutter. And fat. Not just tight, her girdle actually hurts.
Somewhere recently she&rsquo;s read about women getting heart attacks or cancer or something from
too-tight girdles. Dolly pulls the car door shut with a grunt, strangely irritated, not knowing why.
Party mood. Why is her husband humming Who&rsquo;s Sorry Now? Pulling out of the drive, she glances
back at the lighted kitchen window. &#8220;What do you think of our babysitter?&#8221; she asks. While her
husband stumbles all over himself trying to answer, she pulls a stocking tight, biting deeper with
the garters.

&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; she laughs. Bitsy is pulling on her skirt and he is tickling her in the ribs. &#8220;Jimmy!
Don&rsquo;t!&#8221; But she is laughing too much to stop him. He leaps on her, wrapping his legs around her
waist, and they all fall to the carpet in front of the TV, where just now a man in a tuxedo and a
little girl in a flouncy white dress are doing a tapdance together. The babysitter&rsquo;s blouse is pulling
out of her skirt, showing a patch of bare tummy: the target. &#8220;I&rsquo;ll spank!&#8221;

Jack pushes the plunger, thrusting up a steel ball, and bends studiously over the machine. &#8220;You
getting any off her?&#8221; Mark asks, and clears his throat, flicks ash from his cigarette. &#8220;Well, not
exactly, not yet,&#8221; Jack says, grinning awkwardly, but trying to suggest more than he admits to, and
fires. He heaves his weight gently against the machine as the ball bounds off a rubber bumper.
He can feel her warming up under his hands, the flippers suddenly coming alive, delicate rapid-
fire patterns emerging in the flashing of the lights. =1000 when lit!= <em>now!</em> &#8220;Got my hand on it,
that&rsquo;s about all.&#8221; Mark glances up from the machine, cigarette dangling from his lip. &#8220;Maybe you
need some help,&#8221; he suggests with a wry one-sided grin. &#8220;Like maybe together, man, we could do
it.&#8221;

She likes the big tub. She uses the Tuckers&rsquo; bath salts, and loves to sink into the hot fragrant
suds. She can stretch out, submerged, up to her chin. It gives her a good sleepy tingly feeling.

&#8220;What do you think of our babysitter?&#8221; Dolly asks, adjusting a garter. &#8220;Oh, I hardly noticed,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;Cute girl. She seems to get along fine with the kids. Why?&#8221; &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know.&#8221; His wife tugs
her skirt down, glances at a lighted window they are passing, adding: &#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure I trust her
completely, that&rsquo;s all. With the baby, I mean. She seems a little careless. And the other time, I&rsquo;m
almost sure she had a boyfriend over.&#8221; He grins, claps one hand on his wife&rsquo;s broad gartered
thigh. &#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with that?&#8221; he asks. Still in anklets, too. Bare thighs, no girdles, nothing up
there but a flimsy pair of panties and soft adolescent flesh. He&rsquo;s flooded with vague
remembrances of football matches and movie balconies.

How tiny and rubbery it is! She thinks, soaping between the boy&rsquo;s legs, giving him his bath. Just
a funny jiggly little thing that looks like it shouldn&rsquo;t even be there at all. Is that what all the songs
are about?

Jack watches Mark lunge and twist against the machine. Got her running now, racking them up.
He&rsquo;s not too excited about the idea of Mark fooling around with his girlfriend, but Mark&rsquo;s a cooler
operator than he is, and maybe, doing it together this once, he&rsquo;d get over his own timidity. And if
she didn&rsquo;t like it, there were other girls around. If Mark went too far, he could cut him off, too. He
feels his shoulders tense: enough&rsquo;s enough, man... but sees the flesh, too. &#8220;Maybe I&rsquo;ll call her
later,&#8221; he says.

first, come on in! By golly, Dolly, you&rsquo;re looking younger every day! How do you do it? Give my

8:00. The babysitter runs water in the tub, combs her hair in front of the bathroom mirror.
There&rsquo;s a western on television, so she lets Jimmy watch it while she gives Bitsy her bath. But
Bitsy doesn&rsquo;t want a bath. She&rsquo;s angry and crying because she has to be first. The babysitter tells
her if she&rsquo;ll take her bath quickly, she&rsquo;ll let her watch television while Jimmy takes his bath, but it
does no good. The little girl fights to get out of the bathroom, and the babysitter has to squat
with her back against the door and forcibly undress the child. There are better places to babysit.
Both children mind badly, and then, sooner or later, the baby is sure to wake up for a nappy
change and more bottle. The Tuckers do have a good colour TV, though, and she hopes things will
be settled down enough to catch the 8:30 programme. She thrusts the child into the tub, but she&rsquo;s
still screaming and thrashing around. &#8220;Stop it now, Bitsy, or you&rsquo;ll wake the baby!&#8221; &#8220;I have to go
potty,&#8221; the child wails, switching tactics. The babysitter sighs, lifts the girl out of the tub and onto
the toilet, getting her skirt and blouse all wet in the process. She glances at herself in the mirror.
Before she knows it, the girl is off the seat and out of the bathroom. &#8220;Bitsy! Come back here!&#8221;
*
[page=20]
[place=living_room]
[bg-image=url(images/Living_Room.jpeg)]
&#8220;Okay, that&rsquo;s enough!&#8221; Her skirt is ripped and she&rsquo;s flushed and crying. &#8220;Who says?&#8221; &#8220;I do, man!&#8221;
The bastard goes for her, but he tackles him. They roll and tumble. Tables tip, lights topple, the
TV crashes to the floor. He slams a hard right to the guy&rsquo;s gut, clips his chin with a rolling left.

&#8220;We hope it&rsquo;s a girl.&#8221; That&rsquo;s hardly surprising, since they already have four boys. Dolly
congratulates the woman like everybody else, but she doesn&rsquo;t envy her, not a bit. That&rsquo;s all she
needs about now. She stares across the room at Harry, who is slapping backs and getting loud, as
usual. He&rsquo;s spreading out through the middle, so why the hell does he have to complain about her
all the time? &#8220;Dolly, you&rsquo;re looking younger every day!&#8221; was the nice greeting she got tonight.
&#8220;What&rsquo;s your secret?&#8221; And Harry: &#8220;It&rsquo;s all those calories. She&rsquo;s getting back her baby fat.&#8221; &#8220;Haw,
haw! Harry, have a heart!&#8221;

&#8220;Get her feet!&#8221; he hollers at Bitsy, his fingers in her ribs, running over her naked tummy, tangling
in the underbrush of straps and strange clothing. &#8220;Get her shoes off!&#8221; He holds her pinned by
pressing his head against her soft chest. &#8220;No! No, Jimmy! Bitsy, stop!&#8221; But though she kicks and
twists and rolls around, she doesn&rsquo;t get up, she can&rsquo;t get up, she&rsquo;s laughing too hard, and the
shoes come off, and he grabs a stocking foot and scratches the sole ruthlessly, and she raises up
her legs, trying to pitch him off, she&rsquo;s wild, boy, but he hangs on, and she&rsquo;s laughing, and on the
screen there&rsquo;s a rattle of hooves, and he and Bitsy are rolling around and around on the floor in a
crazy rodeo of long bucking legs.

He slips the coin in. There&rsquo;s a metallic fall and a sharp click as the dial tone begins. &#8220;I hope the
Tuckers have gone,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;re at our place,&#8221; Mark says. &#8220;They&rsquo;re always the
first ones to come and the last ones to go home. My old man&rsquo;s always bitching about them.&#8221; Jack
laughs nervously and dials the number. &#8220;Tell her we&rsquo;re coming over to protect her from getting
raped,&#8221; Mark suggests, and lights a cigarette. Jack grins, leaning casually against the door jamb of
the phone booth, chewing gum, one hand in his pocket. He&rsquo;s really pretty uneasy, though. He has
the feeling he&rsquo;s somehow messing up a good thing.

Bitsy runs naked into the living-room, keeping a hassock between herself and the babysitter.
&#8220;Bitsy...!&#8221; the babysitter threatens. Artificial reds and greens and purples flicker over the child&rsquo;s
wet body, as hooves clatter, guns crackle, and stagecoach wheels thunder over rutted terrain. &#8220;Get
outa the way, Bitsy!&#8221; the boy complains. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t see!&#8221; Bitsy streaks past and the babysitter chases,
cornering the girl in the back bedroom. Bitsy throws something that hits her softly in the face: a
pair of men&rsquo;s undershorts. She grabs the girl scampering by, carries her to the bathroom, and
with a smart crack on her glistening bottom pops her back into the tub. In spite, Bitsy peepees in
the bathwater.

Mr. Tucker stirs a little water into his bourbon and kids with his host and another man, just
arrived, about their golf games. They set up a match for the weekend, a threesome looking for a
fourth. Holding his drink in his right hand, Mr. Tucker swings his left through the motion of a tee-
shot. &#8220;You&rsquo;ll have to give me a stroke a hole,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&rsquo;ll give you a stroke!&#8221; says his host. &#8220;Bend
over!&#8221; Laughing, the other man asks: &#8220;Where&rsquo;s your boy Mark tonight?&#8221; &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know,&#8221; replies the
host, gathering up a trayful of drinks. Then he adds in a low growl: &#8220;Out chasing tail probably.&#8221;
They chuckle loosely at that, then shrug in commiseration and return to the livingroom to join
their women.

A hard blow to the belly. The face. The dark beardy one staggers. The lean-jawed sheriff moves
in, but gets a spurred boot in his face. The dark one hurls himself forward, drives his shoulder
into the sheriff&rsquo;s hard midriff, her own tummy tightens, withstands, as the sheriff smashes the
dark man&rsquo;s nose, slams him up against a wall, slugs him again! and again! The dark man grunts
rhythmically, backs off, then plunges suicidally forward &mdash; her own knees draw up protectively &mdash;
the sheriff staggers! caught low! but instead of following through the other man steps back &mdash; a
pistol! the dark one has a pistol! the sheriffs draws! shoots from the hip! explosions! she clutches
her hands between her thighs &mdash; no! the sheriff spins! wounded! the dark man hesitates, aims, her
legs stiffen towards the set, the sheriff rolls desperately in the straw, fires: dead! the dark man is
dead! groans, crumples, his pistol drooping in his collapsing hand, dropping, he drops. The
sheriff, spent, nicked, watches weakly from the floor where he lies. Oh, to be whole! to be good
and strong and right! to embrace and be embraced by harmony and wholeness! The sheriff,
drawing himself painfully up on one elbow, rubs his bruised mouth with the back of his other
hand.

Probably some damn kid over there right now. Wrestling around on the couch in front of his TV.
Maybe he should drop back to the house. Just to check. None of that stuff, she was there to do a
job! Park the car a couple doors down, slip in the front door before she knows it. He sees the
disarray of clothing, the young thighs exposed to the flickering television light, hears his baby
crying. &#8220;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on here! Get outa here, son, before I call the police!&#8221; Of course, they
haven&rsquo;t really been doing anything. They probably don&rsquo;t even know how. He stares benignly
down upon the girl, her skirt rumpled loosely around her thighs. Flushed, frightened, yet excited,
she stares back at him. He smiles. His finger touches a knee, approaches the hem. Another
couple arrives. Filling up here with people. He wouldn&rsquo;t be missed. Just slip out, stop back
casually to pick up something or other he forgot, never mind what. He remembers that the other
time they had this babysitter, she took a bath in their house. She had a date afterwards, and she&rsquo;d
just come from cheerleading practice or something. Aspirin maybe. Just drop quietly and
casually into the bathroom to pick up some aspirin. &#8220;Oh, excuse me, dear! I only...!&#8221; She gazes
back at him, astonished, yet strangely moved. Her soft wet breasts rise and fall in the water, and
her tummy looks pale and ripply. He recalls that her pubic hairs, left in the tub, were brown. Light
brown.

She&rsquo;s no more than stepped into the tub for a quick bath, when Jimmy announces from outside
the door that he has to go to the bathroom. She sighs: just an excuse, she knows. &#8220;You&rsquo;ll have to
wait.&#8221; The little nuisance. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t wait.&#8221; &#8220;Okay, then come ahead, but I&rsquo;m taking a bath.&#8221; She
supposes that will stop him, but it doesn&rsquo;t. In he comes. She slides down into the suds until she&rsquo;s
eye-level with the edge of the tub. He hesitates. &#8220;Go ahead, if you have to,&#8221; she says, a little
awkwardly, &#8220;but I&rsquo;m not getting out.&#8221; &#8220;Don&rsquo;t look,&#8221; he says. She: &#8220;I will if I want to.&#8221;

&#8220;Enough&rsquo;s enough, Mark! Now get outa here!&#8221; Her skirt is ripped to the waist, her bare hip
bruised. Her panties lie on the floor like a broken balloon. Later, he&rsquo;ll wash her wounds, help her
dress, he&rsquo;ll take care of her. Pity washes through him, giving him a sudden hard-on. Mark laughs
at it, pointing. Jack crouches, waiting, ready for anything.

Laughing, they roll and tumble. Their little hands are all over her, digging and pinching. She

&#8220;Spank her, Jimmy!&#8221; His swats sting: is her skirt up? The phone rings. &#8220;The cavalry to the rescue!&#8221;

Kissing Mark, her eyes closed, her hips nudge towards Jack. He stares at the TV screen, unsure of
himself, one hand slipping cautiously under her skirt. Her hand touches his arm as though to
resist, then brushes on by to rub his leg. This blanket they&rsquo;re under was a good idea. &#8220;Hi! This is

Bitsy&rsquo;s out and the water&rsquo;s running. &#8220;Come on, Jimmy, your turn!&#8221; Last time, he told her he took
his own baths, but she came in anyway. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not gonna take a bath,&#8221; he announces, eyes glued on
the set. He readies for the struggle. &#8220;But I&rsquo;ve already run your water. Come on, Jimmy, please!&#8221;
He shakes his head. She can&rsquo;t make him, he&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s as strong as she is. She sighs. &#8220;Well, it&rsquo;s up
to you. I&rsquo;ll use the water myself then,&#8221; she says. He waits until he&rsquo;s pretty sure she&rsquo;s not going to
change her mind, then sneaks in and peeks through the keyhole in the bathroom door: just in
time to see her big bottom as she bends over to stir in the bubblebath. Then she disappears.
Trying to see as far down as the keyhole will allow, he bumps his head on the knob. &#8220;Jimmy, is
that you?&#8221; &#8220;I &mdash; I have to go to the bathroom!&#8221; he stammers.

Not actually in the tub, just getting in. One foot on the mat, the other in the water. Bent over
slightly, buttocks flexed, teats swaying, holding on to the edge of the tub. &#8220;Oh, excuse me! I only
wanted...!&#8221; He passes over her astonishment, the awkward excuses, moves quickly to the part
where he reaches out to &mdash; &#8220;What on earth are you doing, Harry?&#8221; his wife asks, staring at his
hand. His host, passing, laughs. &#8220;He&rsquo;s practising his swing for Sunday, Dolly, but it&rsquo;s not going to

most of the show. She decides maybe she&rsquo;ll take a quick bath. Jack might come by anyway, it&rsquo;d
make her mad, that&rsquo;d be the end as far as he was concerned, but if he should, she doesn&rsquo;t want to
be all sweaty. And besides, she likes the big tub the Tuckers have.

He is self-conscious and stands with his back to her, his little neck flushed. It takes him forever
to get started, and when it finally does come, it&rsquo;s just a tiny trickle. &#8220;See, it was just an excuse,&#8221;
she scolds, but she&rsquo;s giggling inwardly at the boy&rsquo;s embarrassment. &#8220;You&rsquo;re just a nuisance,
Jimmy.&#8221; At the door, his hand on the knob, he hesitates, staring timidly down on his shoes.
&#8220;Jimmy?&#8221; She peeks at him over the edge of the tub, trying to keep a straight face, as he sneaks a
nervous glance back over his shoulder. &#8220;As long as you bothered me,&#8221; she says, &#8220;you might as well
soap my back.&#8221;

&#8220;The aspirin...&#8221; They embrace. She huddles in his arms like a child. Lovingly, paternally,
knowledgeably, he wraps her nakedness. How compact, how tight and small her body is! Kissing
her ear, he stares down past her rump at the still clear water. &#8220;I&rsquo;ll join you,&#8221; he whispers hoarsely.

She picks up the shorts Bitsy threw at her. Men&rsquo;s underwear. She holds them in front of her,
looks at herself in the bedroom mirror. About twenty sizes too big for her, of course. She runs her
hand inside the opening in front, pulls out her thumb. How funny it must feel!

&#8220;Well, man, I say we just go rape her,&#8221; Mark says flatly, and swings his weight against the pinball
machine. &#8220;Uff! Ahh! Get in there, you mother! Look at that! Hah! Man, I&rsquo;m gonna turn this baby
over!&#8221; Jack is embarrassed about the phone conversation. Mark just snorted in disgust when he
hung up. He cracks down hard on his gum, angry that he&rsquo;s such a chicken. &#8220;Well, I&rsquo;m game if you
are,&#8221; he says coldly.

8:30 &#8220;Okay, come on, Jimmy, it&rsquo;s time.&#8221; He ignores her. The western gives way to a spy show.
Bitsy, in pyjamas, pads into the livingroom. &#8220;No, Bitsy, it&rsquo;s time to go to bed.&#8221; &#8220;You said I could
watch!&#8221; the girl whines, and starts to throw another tantrum. &#8220;But you were too slow and it&rsquo;s late.
Jimmy, you get in that bathroom, and right now!&#8221; Jimmy stares sullenly at the set, unmoving. The
babysitter tries to catch the opening scene of the television programme so she can follow it later,
since Jimmy gives himself his own baths. When the commercial interrupts, she turns off the
sound, stands in front of the screen. &#8220;Okay, into the tub, Jimmy Tucker, or I&rsquo;ll take you in there
and give you your bath myself!&#8221; &#8220;Just try it,&#8221; he says, &rsquo;and see what happens.&#8221;

They stand outside, in the dark, crouched in the bushes, peeking in. She&rsquo;s on the floor, playing
with the kids. Too early. They seem to be tickling her. She gets to her hands and knees, but the
little girl leaps on her head, pressing her face to the floor. There&rsquo;s an obvious target, and the little
boy proceeds to beat on it. &#8220;Hey, look at that kid go!&#8221; whispers Mark, laughing and snapping his
fingers softly. Jack feels uneasy out here. Too many neighbours, too many cars going by, too
many people in the world. That little boy in there is one up on him, though: he&rsquo;s never thought
about tickling her as a starter.

His little hand, clutching the bar of soap, lathers shyly a narrow space between her
shoulderblades. She is doubled forward against her knees, buried in rich suds, peeking at him
over the edge of her shoulder. The soap slithers out of his grip and plunks into the water. &#8220;I... I
dropped the soap,&#8221; he whispers. She: &#8220;Find it.&#8221;

they&rsquo;re laughing, they&rsquo;re all laughing, damn! he&rsquo;s feeling pretty goddamn good at that, and now
he just knows he needs that aspirin. Watching her there, her thighs spread for him, on the couch,
in the tub, hell, on the kitchen table for that matter, he tees off on Number Nine, and &mdash; whap &mdash;
swats his host&rsquo;s wife on the bottom. &#8220;Hole in one!&#8221; he shouts. &#8220;Harry!&#8221; Why can&rsquo;t his goddamn
wife Dolly ever get happy-drunk instead of sour-drunk all the time? &#8220;Gonna be tough Sunday, old

The babysitter lunges forward, grabs the boy by the arms and hauls him off the couch, pulling
two cushions with him, and drags him towards the bathroom. He lashes out, knocking over an
endtable full of magazines and ashtrays. &#8220;You leave my brother alone!&#8221; Bitsy cries and grabs the
sitter around the waist. Jimmy jumps on her and down they all go. On the silent screen, there&rsquo;s a
fade-in to a dark passageway in an old apartment building in some foreign country. She kicks out
and somebody falls between her legs. Somebody else is sitting on her face. &#8220;Jimmy! Stop that!&#8221;
the babysitter laughs, her voice muffled.

She&rsquo;s watching television. All alone. It seems like a good time to go in. Just remember: really, no
matter what she says, she wants it. They&rsquo;re standing in the bushes, trying to get up the nerve.
&#8220;We&rsquo;ll tell her to be good,&#8221; Mark whispers, &rsquo;and if she&rsquo;s not good, we&rsquo;ll spank her.&#8221; Jack giggles
softly, but his knees are weak. She stands. They freeze. She looks right at them. &#8220;She can&rsquo;t see
us,&#8221; Mark whispers tensely. &#8220;Is she coming out?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; says Mark, &rsquo;she&rsquo;s going into &mdash; that must be
the bathroom!&#8221; Jack takes a deep breath, his heart pounding. &#8220;Hey, is there a window back there?&#8221;
Mark asks.

The phone rings. She leaves the tub, wrapped in a towel. Bitsy gives a tug on the towel. &#8220;Hey,
Jimmy, get the towel!&#8221; she squeals. &#8220;Now stop that, Bitsy!&#8221; the babysitter hisses, but too late: with
one hand on the phone, the other isn&rsquo;t big enough to hang on to the towel. Her sudden
nakedness awes them and it takes them a moment to remember about tickling her. By then, she&rsquo;s
in the towel again. &#8220;I hope you got a good look,&#8221; she says angrily. She feels chilled and oddly a
little frightened. &#8220;Hello?&#8221; No answer. She glances at the window &mdash; is somebody out there?
Something, she saw something, and a rustling &mdash; footsteps?

[page=48]


[bg-image=url(images/Living_Room.jpeg)]
&#8220;Okay, I don&rsquo;t care, Jimmy, don&rsquo;t take a bath,&#8221; she says irritably. Her blouse is pulled out and
wrinkled, her hair is all mussed, and she feels sweaty. There&rsquo;s about a million things she&rsquo;d rather
be doing than babysitting with these two. Three: at least the baby&rsquo;s sleeping. She knocks on the
overturned endtable for luck, rights it, replaces the magazines and ashtrays. The one thing that
really makes her sick is a dirty nappy. &#8220;Just go on to bed.&#8221; &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have to go to bed until nine,&#8221; he
reminds her. Really, she couldn&rsquo;t care less. She turns up the volume on the TV, settles down on
the couch, poking her blouse back into her skirt, pushing her hair out of her eyes. Jimmy and
Bitsy watch from the floor. Maybe, once they&rsquo;re in bed, she&rsquo;ll take a quick bath. She wishes Jack
would come by. The man, no doubt the spy, is following a woman, but she doesn&rsquo;t know why. The
woman passes another man. Something seems to happen, but it&rsquo;s not clear what. She&rsquo;s probably
already missed too much. The phone rings.

Mark is kissing her. Jack is under the blanket, easing her panties down over her squirming hips.
Her hand is in his pants, pulling it out, pulling it towards her, pulling it hard. She knew just
where it was! Mark is stripping, too. God, it&rsquo;s really happening! he thinks with a kind of pious joy,
and notices the open door. &#8220;Hey! What&rsquo;s going on here?&#8221;

He soaps her back, smooth and slippery under his hand. She is doubled over, against her knees,
between his legs. Her light brown hair, reaching to her gleaming shoulders, is wet at the edges.
The soap slips, falls between his legs. He fishes for it, finds it, slips it behind him. &#8220;Help me find
it,&#8221; he whispers in her ear. &#8220;Sure Harry,&#8221; says his host, going round behind him. &#8220;What&rsquo;d you
lose?&#8221;

Soon be nine, time to pack the kids off to bed. She clears the table, dumps paper plates and
leftover hamburgers into the garbage, puts glasses and silverware into the sink, and the
mayonnaise, mustard, and ketchup in the refrigerator. Neither child has eaten much supper
finally, mostly potato chips and ice-cream, but it&rsquo;s really not her problem. She glances at the
books on the refrigerator. Not much chance she&rsquo;ll get to them, she&rsquo;s already pretty worn out.
Maybe she&rsquo;d feel better if she had a quick bath. She runs water into the tub, tosses in bubblebath
salts, undresses. Before pushing down her panties, she stares for a moment at the smooth silken
panel across her tummy, fingers the place where the opening would be if there were one. Then
she steps quickly out of them, feeling somehow ashamed, unhooks her brassiere. She weighs her
breasts in the palms of her hands, watching herself in the bathroom mirror, where in the open
window behind her, she sees a face. She screams.

She screams: &#8220;Jimmy! Give me that!&#8221; &#8220;What&rsquo;s the matter?&#8221; asks Jack on the other end. &#8220;Jimmy!
Give me my towel! Right now!&#8221; &#8220;Hello? Hey, are you still there?&#8221; &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry, Jack,&#8221; she says,
panting. &#8220;You caught me in the tub. I&rsquo;m just wrapped in a towel and these silly kids grabbed it
away!&#8221; &#8220;Gee, I wish I&rsquo;d been there!&#8221; &#8220;Jack &mdash;!&#8221; &#8220;To protect you, I mean.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, sure,&#8221; she says,
giggling. &#8220;Well, what do you think, can I come over and watch TV with you?&#8221; &#8220;Well, not right this
minute,&#8221; she says. He laughs lightly. He feels very cool. &#8220;Jack?&#8221; &#8220;Yeah?&#8221; &#8220;Jack, I... I think there&rsquo;s
somebody outside the window!&#8221;

She carries him, fighting all the way, to the tub, Bitsy pummelling her in the back and kicking
her ankles. She can&rsquo;t hang on to him and undress him at the same time. &#8220;I&rsquo;ll throw you in, clothes
and all, Jimmy Tucker!&#8221; she gasps. &#8220;You better not!&#8221; he cries. She sits on the toilet seat, locks her
legs around him, whips his shirt up over his head before he knows what&rsquo;s happening. The pants
are easier. Like all little boys his age, he has almost no hips at all. He hangs on desperately to his
underpants, but when she succeeds in snapping these down out of his grip, too, he gives up, starts
to bawl, and beats her wildly in the face with his fists. She ducks her head, laughing hysterically,
oddly entranced by the spectacle of that pale little thing down there, bobbing and bouncing
rubberily about with the boy&rsquo;s helpless fury and anguish.

They can tell she&rsquo;s naked and about to get into the tub, but the bathroom window is frosted

her on the phone, and the other watches when she comes out.&#8221; &#8220;Okay, but who calls?&#8221; &#8220;Both of us,

nice girl,&#8221; he says coldly, and nods at Jack. When she&rsquo;s doubled over like that, her skirt rides up

Parks the car a couple blocks away. Slips up to the house, glances in his window. Just like he&rsquo;s
expected. Her blouse is off and the kid&rsquo;s shirt is unbuttoned. He watches, while slowly, clumsily,
childishly, they fumble with each other&rsquo;s clothes. My God, it takes them forever. &#8220;Some party!&#8221;
&#8220;You said it!&#8221; When they&rsquo;re more or less naked, he walks in. &#8220;Hey! What&rsquo;s going on here?&#8221; They

Bitsy&rsquo;s sleeping on the floor. The babysitter is taking a bath. For more than an hour now, he&rsquo;s
had to use the bathroom. He doesn&rsquo;t know how much longer he can wait. Finally, he goes to
knock on the bathroom door. &#8220;I have to use the bathroom.&#8221; &#8220;Well, come ahead, if you have to.&#8221;
&#8220;Not while you&rsquo;re in there.&#8221; She sighs loudly. &#8220;Okay, okay, just a minute,&#8221; she says, &rsquo;but you&rsquo;re a

He arrives just in time to see her emerge from the bathroom, wrapped in a towel, to answer the
phone. His two kids sneak up behind her and pull the towel away. She&rsquo;s trying to hang onto the
phone and get the towel back at the same time. It&rsquo;s quite a picture. She&rsquo;s got a sweet ass.
Standing there in the bushes, pawing himself with one hand, he lifts his glass with the other and
toasts her sweet ass, which his son now swats. Haw, haw, maybe that boy&rsquo;s gonna shape up, after

They&rsquo;re in the bushes, arguing about their next move, when she comes out of the bathroom,
wrapped in a towel. They can hear the baby crying. Then it stops. They see her running, naked,
back to the bathroom like she&rsquo;s scared or something. &#8220;I&rsquo;m going in after her, man, whether you&rsquo;re
with me or not!&#8221; Mark whispers and he starts out of the bushes. But just then, a light comes
sweeping up through the yard, as a car swings in the drive. They hit the dirt, hearts pounding. &#8220;Is

9:00. Having missed most of the spy show anyway and having little else to do, the babysitter has
washed the dishes and cleaned the kitchen up a little. The books on the refrigerator remind her
of her better intentions, but she decides that first she&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s next on TV. In the livingroom,
she finds little Bitsy sound asleep on the floor. She lifts her gently, carries her into her bed, and
tucks her in. &#8220;Okay, Jimmy, it&rsquo;s nine o&rsquo;clock, I&rsquo;ve let you stay up, now be a good boy.&#8221; Sullenly, his
sleepy eyes glued still to the set, the boy backs out of the room towards his bedroom. A drama
comes on. She switches channels. A ballgame and a murder mystery. She switches back to the
drama. It&rsquo;s a love story of some kind. A man married to an ageing invalid wife, but in love with a
younger girl. &#8220;Use the bathroom and brush your teeth before going to bed, Jimmy!&#8221; she calls, but
as quickly regrets it, for she hears the baby stir in its crib.

retreat to ease her girdle down awhile, get a few good deep breaths. She has this picture of her
three kids carting her off to a rest home. In a wheelbarrow. That sure is something to look
forward to, all right. When she pulls her girdle back up, she can&rsquo;t seem to squeeze into it. The

The young lover feels sorry for her rival, the invalid wife; she believes the man has a duty
towards the poor woman and insists she is willing to wait. But the man argues that he also has a
duty towards himself: his life, too, is short, and he could not love his wife now even were she well.
He embraces the young girl feverishly; she twists away in anguish. The door opens. They stand
there grinning, looking devilish, but pretty silly at the same time. &#8220;Jack! I thought I told you not
to come!&#8221; She&rsquo;s angry, but she&rsquo;s also glad in a way: she was beginning to feel a little too alone in

She&rsquo;s just sunk down into the tubful of warm fragrant suds, ready for a nice long soaking, when
the phone rings. Wrapping a towel around her, she goes to answer: no one there. But now the
baby&rsquo;s awake and bawling. She wonders if that&rsquo;s Jack bothering her all the time. If it is, brother,
that&rsquo;s the end. Maybe it&rsquo;s the end anyway. She tries to calm the baby with the half-empty bottle,
not wanting to change it until she&rsquo;s finished her bath. The bathroom&rsquo;s where the diapers go dirty,
and they make it stink to high heaven. &#8220;Shush, shush!&#8221; she whispers, rocking the crib. The towel
slips away, leaving an airy empty tingle up and down her backside. Even before she stoops for the
towel, even before she turns around, she knows there&rsquo;s somebody behind her.

&#8220;We just came by to see if you were being a good girl,&#8221; Jack says, grinning down at her. She&rsquo;s
flushed and silent, her mouth half open. &#8220;Lean over,&#8221; says Mark amiably. &#8220;We&rsquo;ll soap your back, as
long as we&rsquo;re here.&#8221; But she just huddles there, down in the suds, staring up at them with big
eyes.

&#8220;Hey! What&rsquo;s going on here?&#8221; It&rsquo;s Mr. Tucker, stumbling through the door with a drink in his
hand. She looks up from the TV. &#8220;What&rsquo;s the matter, Mr. Tucker?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, uh, I&rsquo;m sorry. I got lost &mdash;
no, I mean, I had to get some aspirin. Excuse me!&#8221; And he rushes past her into the bathroom,
caroming off the livingroom door jamb on the way. The baby wakes.

&#8220;Okay, get off her. Mr. Tucker!&#8221; &#8220;Jack!&#8221; she cries, &rsquo;what are you doing here?&#8221; He stares hard at
them a moment: so that&rsquo;s where it goes. Then, as Mr. Tucker swings heavily off, he leans into the
bastard with a hard right to the belly. Next thing he knows, though, he&rsquo;s got a face full of an old
man&rsquo;s fist. He&rsquo;s not sure, as the lights go out, if that&rsquo;s his girlfriend screaming or the baby...

Her host pushes down on her fat fanny and tugs with all his might on her girdle, while she bawls
on his shoulder: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t wanna go to a rest home!&#8221; &#8220;Now, now, take it easy, Dolly, nobody&rsquo;s gonna
make you &mdash;&rsquo; &#8220;Ouch! Hey, you&rsquo;re hurting!&#8221; &#8220;You should buy a bigger girdle, Dolly.&#8221; &#8220;You&rsquo;re telling

By the time she&rsquo;s chased Jack and Mark out of there, she&rsquo;s lost track of the programme she&rsquo;s
been watching on television. There&rsquo;s another woman in the story now for some reason. That guy
lives a very complicated life. Impatiently, she switches channels. She hates ballgames, so she
settles for the murder mystery. She switches just in time, too: there&rsquo;s a dead man sprawled out on
the floor of what looks like an office or a study or something. A heavyset detective gazes up from
his couch over the body: &#8220;He&rsquo;s been strangled.&#8221; Maybe she&rsquo;ll take that bath, after all.

She drags him into the bathroom and pulls his pants down. She soaps up a warm washcloth
she&rsquo;s had in the tub with her, but just as she reaches between his legs, it starts to spurt, spraying
her arms and hands. &#8220;Oh, Jimmy! I thought you were done!&#8221; she cries, pulling him towards the
toilet and aiming it into the bowl. How moist and rubbery it is! And you can turn it every which
way. How funny it must feel!

&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; she screams. &#8220;Please stop!&#8221; She&rsquo;s on her hands and knees and Jack is holding her head
down. &#8220;Now we&rsquo;re gonna teach you how to be a nice girl,&#8221; Mark says and lifts her skirt. &#8220;Well, I&rsquo;ll
be damned!&#8221; &#8220;What&rsquo;s the matter?&#8221; asks Jack, his heart pounding. &#8220;Look at this big pair of men&rsquo;s
underpants she&rsquo;s got on!&#8221; &#8220;Those are my daddy&rsquo;s!&#8221; says Jimmy, watching them from the doorway.
&#8220;I&rsquo;m gonna tell!&#8221;

People are shooting at each other in the murder mystery, but she&rsquo;s so mixed up, she doesn&rsquo;t
know which ones are the good guys. She switches back to the love story. Something seems to
have happened. because now the man is kissing his invalid wife tenderly. Maybe she&rsquo;s finally
dying. The baby wakes, begins to scream. Let it. She turns up the volume on the TV.

Leaning down over her, unbuckling his belt. It&rsquo;s all happening just like he&rsquo;s known it would.
Beautiful! The kid is gone, though his pants, poor lad, remain. &#8220;Looks like you and me, we got a
secret to keep, child!&#8221; But he&rsquo;s cramped on the couch and everything is too slippery and small.
&#8220;Lift your legs up, honey. Put them around my back.&#8221; But instead she screams. He rolls off,
crashing to the floor. There they all come, through the front door. On television, somebody is
saying: &#8220;Am I a burden to you, darling?&#8221; &#8220;Dolly! My God! Dolly, I can explain...!&#8221;

The game of the night is Get Dolly Tucker Back in Her Girdle Again. They&rsquo;ve got her down on her
belly in the livingroom and the whole damn crowd is working on her. Several of them are
stretching the girdle, while others try to jam the fat inside. &#8220;I think we made a couple inches on
this side! Roll her over!&#8221; Harry?

She&rsquo;s just stepped into the tub, when the phone rings, waking the baby. She sinks down in the
suds, trying not to hear. But that baby doesn&rsquo;t cry, it screams. Angrily, she wraps a towel around
herself, stamps peevishly into the baby&rsquo;s room, just letting the phone jangle. She tosses the baby
down on its back, unpins its nappies hastily, and gets yellowish baby stool all over her hands. Her
towel drops away. She turns to find Jimmy staring at her like a little idiot. She slaps him in the
face with her dirty hand, while the baby screams, the phone rings, and nagging voices argue on
the TV. There are better things she might be doing.

What&rsquo;s happening? Now there&rsquo;s a young guy in it. Is he after the young girl or the old invalid?
To tell the truth, it looks like he&rsquo;s after the same man the women are. In disgust, she switches
channels. &#8220;The strangler again,&#8221; growls the fat detective, hands on hips, staring down at the body
of a half-naked girl. She&rsquo;s considering either switching back to the love story or taking a quick
bath, when a hand suddenly clutches her mouth.

asks nervously.

How did he get here? He&rsquo;s standing pissing in his own goddamn bathroom, his wife is still back
at the party, the three of them are, like good kids, sitting in there in the living-room watching TV.
One of them is his host&rsquo;s boy Mark. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a good murder mystery, Mr. Tucker,&#8221; Mark said, when he
came staggering in on them a minute ago. &#8220;Sit still!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I&rsquo;m just home for a moment!&#8221;
Then whump thump on into the bathroom. Long hike for a weewee, Mister. But something keeps
bothering him. Then it hits him: the girl&rsquo;s panties, hanging like a broken balloon from the rabbit-
ear antennae on the TV! He barges back in there, giving his shoulder a helluva crack on the
livingroom door jamb on the way &mdash; but they&rsquo;re not hanging there any more. Maybe he&rsquo;s only
imagined it. &#8220;Hey, Mr. Tucker,&#8221; Mark says flatly. &#8220;Your fly&rsquo;s open.&#8221;

The baby&rsquo;s dirty, stinks to high heaven. She hurries back to the livingroom, hearing sirens and
gunshots. The detective is crouched outside a house, peering in. Already, she&rsquo;s completely lost.
The baby screams at the top of its lungs. She turns up the volume. But it&rsquo;s all confused. She
hurries back in there, claps an angry hand to the baby&rsquo;s mouth. &#8220;Shut up!&#8221; she cries. She throws
the baby down on its back, starts to unpin the nappy, as the baby tunes up again. The phone
rings. She answers it, one eye on the TV. &#8220;What?&#8221; The baby cries so hard it starts to choke. Let it.
&#8220;I said, hi, this is Jack!&#8221; Then it hits her: oh no! the nappy pin!

Jimmy gets up to go to the bathroom and gets his face slapped and smeared with baby poop.
Then she hauls him off to the bathroom, yanks off his pyjamas, and throws him into the tub.
That&rsquo;s okay, but next she gets naked and acts like she&rsquo;s gonna get in the tub, too. The baby&rsquo;s
screaming and the phone&rsquo;s ringing like crazy and in walks his dad. Saved! he thinks, but, no, his
dad grabs him right back out of the tub and whales the dickens out of him, no questions asked,
while she watches, then sends him &mdash; whack! &mdash; back to bed. So he&rsquo;s lying there, wet and dirty
and naked and sore, and he still has to go to the bathroom, and outside his window he hears two
older guys talking. &#8220;Listen, you know where to do it if we get her pinned?&#8221; &#8220;No! Don&rsquo;t you?&#8221;

&#8220;Yo ho heave ho! Ugh!&#8221; Dolly&rsquo;s on her back and they&rsquo;re working on the belly side. Somebody
got the great idea of buttering her down first. Not to lose the ground they&rsquo;ve gained, they&rsquo;ve shot
it inside with a basting syringe. But now suddenly there&rsquo;s this big tug-of-war under way between
those who want to stuff her in and those who want to let her out. Something rips, but she feels
better. The odour of hot butter makes her think of movie theatres and popcorn. &#8220;Hey, has
anybody seen Harry?&#8221; she asks. &#8220;Where&rsquo;s Harry?&#8221;

the young lover again. What&rsquo;s going on? She gives it up, decides to take a quick bath. She&rsquo;s just
stepping into the tub, one foot in, one foot out, when Mr. Tucker walks in. &#8220;Oh, excuse me! I only
wanted some aspirin...!&#8221; He embraces her savagely, his calloused old hands clutching roughly at
her backside. &#8220;Mr. Tucker!&#8221; she cries, squirming. &#8220;Your wife called &mdash;!&#8221; He&rsquo;s pushing something
between her legs, hurting her. She slips, they both slip &mdash; something cold and hard slams her in
the back, cracks her skull, she seems to be sinking into a sea...

She screams, scaring the hell out of him. He leaps out of the tub, glances up at the window she&rsquo;s

his ass, whacking his head on the sink on the way down. She stares down at him, trembling, a
towel over her narrow shoulders. &#8220;Mr. Tucker! Mr. Tucker, are you all right...?&#8221; Who&rsquo;s Sorry Now?

Down in the suds. Feeling sleepy. The phone rings, startling her. Wrapped in a towel, she goes to
answer. &#8220;No, he&rsquo;s not here, Mrs. Tucker.&#8221; Strange. Married people act pretty funny sometimes.
The baby is awake and screaming. Dirty, a real mess. Oh boy, there&rsquo;s a lot of things she&rsquo;d rather
be doing than babysitting in this madhouse. She decides to wash the baby off in her own
bathwater. She removes her towel, unplugs the tub, lowers the water level so the baby can sit.
Glancing back over her shoulder, she sees Jimmy staring at her. &#8220;Go back to bed, Jimmy.&#8221; &#8220;I have
to go to the bathroom.&#8221; &#8220;Good grief, Jimmy! It looks like you already have!&#8221; The phone rings. She
doesn&rsquo;t bother with the towel &mdash; what can Jimmy see he hasn&rsquo;t already seen? &mdash; and goes to
answer. &#8220;No, Jack, and that&rsquo;s final.&#8221; Sirens, on the TV, as the police move in. But wasn&rsquo;t that the
channel with the love story? Ambulance maybe. Get this over with so she can at least catch the
news. &#8220;Get those wet pyjamas off, Jimmy, and I&rsquo;ll find clean ones. Maybe you better get in the tub,
too.&#8221; &#8220;I think something&rsquo;s wrong with the baby,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s down in the water and it&rsquo;s not

"The Babysitter" by Robert Coover is a complex narrative that explores the intertwining of reality and fantasy over the course of a single evening, from 7:40 to 10:30 p.m. The story is structured through over a hundred paragraphs that present multiple viewpoints, revealing the chaotic and often conflicting perceptions of the characters involved. Central to the plot are the Tuckers, a couple preparing for a cocktail party, and their baby-sitter, whose experiences are shaped by the fantasies of both the children she looks after and her boyfriend and his friend nearby.

As the evening progresses, various scenarios unfold, raising questions about the nature of desire, power, and safety. The narrative offers a multitude of potential outcomes, leaving the reader to ponder the implications of these competing fantasies. The story's richness lies in its exploration of choice and consequence, as each character's imagination shapes their reality. With at least five hundred possible plot lines, "The Babysitter" challenges traditional storytelling by blurring the lines between different narratives, ultimately inviting readers to reflect on the complexity of human relationships and desires.
